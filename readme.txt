Smart related products for WooCommerce overrides default logic of related products display by category and shows them by attributes.

== Description ==

Smart Related Products for WooCommerce lets you choose which products should show in the related products area instead of simply showing products from the same category. Take control of your detail views and show the products that you want!

How to use:

* Go to Woocommerce -> Smart related products and choose how they should be displayed.
* Decide if related products by attributes should also be from the same product category.
* As long as your theme has a related products section, you're done! By default all WooCommerce themes have this, so unless your theme specifically disables it you're all set.

This plugin has been tested with WooCommerce 2.1 through 3.0.

== Installation ==

1. Download Smart Related Products for WooCommerce.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure under WooCommerce > Smart related products
